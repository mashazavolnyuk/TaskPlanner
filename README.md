Let me introduce my TaskPlanner. It's help you don't forget about your business.
So,in what way I can work with it?
STEP 1: you have to create category. For example, name will be "Travel"
STEP 2:after that you can add you tasks ("Travel"->"baggage","visa" etc)
STEP 3:you can add subtask and finish ("Travel"->"baggage"->"buy suntanlotion","take compass")
When you carry out every subtask,you will see how you task checked and one can delete.
